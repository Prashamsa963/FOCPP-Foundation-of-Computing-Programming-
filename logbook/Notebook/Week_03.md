# **Introduction to Programming – Week 3**

### **Lab Logbook Summary**

---

## **Overview**

This lab focused on **decision making and repetition** in Python. It introduced Boolean expressions, conditional statements, and loops. These concepts help programs make decisions and repeat tasks efficiently.

---

## **Boolean Expressions**

Boolean expressions return either:

* `True`
* `False`

They are mainly used in:

* `if` statements
* `while` loops

Boolean expressions help control the flow of a program.

---

## **Relational and Logical Operators**

Relational operators compare values:

* `==` equal to
* `!=` not equal to
* `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`

Logical operators combine conditions:

* `and`
* `or`
* `not`

These operators allow multiple conditions to be checked at once.

---

## **Selection Statements**

Python uses conditional statements to make decisions.

* `if` – checks a condition
* `elif` – checks another condition if the first is false
* `else` – runs when all conditions are false

Only one block of code runs based on the condition result.

---

## **Ternary Operator**

A ternary operator is a short way to write an `if-else` statement in one line.
It makes simple decisions more compact.

---

## **Membership Testing**

Membership operators check if a value exists in a sequence:

* `in`
* `not in`

They are commonly used with strings and lists.

---

## **Loops**

Loops repeat code while a condition is met.

### **While Loop**

* Repeats while a condition is `True`
* Useful when the number of repetitions is unknown

### **For Loop**

* Repeats over a sequence (string, list, range)
* Useful when the number of repetitions is known

---

## **Loop Control Statements**

* `break` – stops the loop completely
* `continue` – skips the current iteration and moves to the next one

These give more control over loop execution.

---

## **Key Terms Learned**

* Boolean expression
* Condition
* Selection
* Iteration
* Loop
* Break
* Continue

---

## **Conclusion**

This lab helped build skills in controlling program flow using conditions and loops. Decision making and repetition are essential for writing efficient and flexible Python programs.
