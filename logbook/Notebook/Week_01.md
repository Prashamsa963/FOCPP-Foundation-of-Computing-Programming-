# **Introduction to Programming – Week 1**

### **Logbook Summary**


## **Overview**

This lab introduced the basic concepts of programming using **Python**. It focused on understanding different types of programming languages, using the Python interpreter, writing simple expressions, learning operator precedence, identifying errors, and understanding key programming terms. These fundamentals form the base for future programming studies.

## **Types of Programming Languages**

Programming languages have developed over time to make coding easier and more efficient.

* **2GL (Second Generation Languages):**
  Low-level languages like **Assembly**, closely related to machine code.

* **3GL (Third Generation Languages):**
  High-level, general-purpose languages such as **Python, C, C++, and Java**. These are easier to read, write, and maintain.

* **4GL (Fourth Generation Languages):**
  Very high-level and domain-specific languages like **SQL and R**, which focus more on *what* needs to be done rather than *how*.

Programming can follow different **paradigms**, such as procedural, object-oriented, functional, and aspect-oriented.
**Python is a multi-paradigm, interpreted 3GL**, making it flexible and beginner-friendly.

## **Python Interpreter and REPL**

Python uses an **interpreter**, which executes code line by line.

* Python follows the **REPL model**: *Read → Evaluate → Print → Loop*
* Interactive mode allows instant testing of code
* The **>>>** prompt shows that Python is ready for input
* Common commands include:

  * `print()` – displays output
  * `help()` – provides documentation
  * `quit()` – exits the interpreter
* Python’s built-in help system is useful for learning syntax and functions

## **Basic Expressions and Operators**

An **expression** is made up of values and operators that produce a result.

Common Python operators include:

* `+`  Addition
* `-`  Subtraction
* `*`  Multiplication
* `/`  Division
* `//` Floor division
* `%`  Modulus (remainder)
* `**` Exponentiation

Expressions are used for calculations, decision-making, and repeating actions in programs.

---

## **Operator Precedence**

Python evaluates expressions based on **operator precedence**, not just left to right.

Order of precedence (highest to lowest):

1. `()`  Parentheses
2. `**`  Exponentiation
3. `* / // %`  Multiplication and division
4. `+ -`  Addition and subtraction

Using parentheses helps control the order of execution and prevents logical mistakes.

## **Errors in Programming**

Errors are a normal part of learning programming and are mainly of two types:

* **Syntax Errors:**
  Occur when Python rules are broken (e.g., missing brackets or incorrect spelling). These are usually easy to fix.

* **Logical (Run-time) Errors:**
  Occur while the program is running due to incorrect logic (e.g., dividing by zero). These errors can be harder to detect.

Good programs check inputs and handle errors properly.

---

## **Key Terminology**

* **Source Code:** Code written by programmers
* **Machine Code:** Binary instructions understood by the computer
* **Interpreter:** Executes code line by line
* **Compiler:** Converts source code into an executable file
* **Executable:** A program that can be run
* **Expression:** Code that evaluates to a value
* **Operator:** Symbol that performs an operation
* **Operand:** Value used in an expression
* **Syntax Error:** Error in code structure
* **Logical Error:** Error in program logic or output

## **Conclusion**

This lab provided a strong foundation in programming concepts and practical experience using Python. Understanding these basics is essential for writing correct programs and for progressing to more advanced programming topics in future labs.
