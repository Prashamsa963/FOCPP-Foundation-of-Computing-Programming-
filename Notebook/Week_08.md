Introduction to Programming – Week 8

Lab Logbook Summary: I/O, String Formatting, and File Handling

Input and Output (I/O)

Input from users via input() or external sources like files.
Output using print() function.
Formatting output improves readability and usability.
String Formatting

f-strings allow embedding variables directly in strings (Python 3.6+):
print(f"Your name is {name}, and your address is {addr}")
Makes strings cleaner and easier to read.
File Handling

Open files using open() with modes: 'r' (read), 'w' (write), 'a' (append).
Read content with read() or readlines().
Write content with write() or writelines().
Always close files using close() or with statement for safety.
Conclusion

This lab covered input/output, string formatting, and file handling, which are essential for interacting with users and storing or retrieving data in Python programs.
