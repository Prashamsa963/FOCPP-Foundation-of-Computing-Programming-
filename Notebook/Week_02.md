Introduction to Programming – Week 2

Lab Logbook Summary

Overview

This lab focused on how Python stores and works with data. It covered variables, data types, built-in functions, user input, strings, indexing, slicing, and lists. These topics help in writing useful and meaningful Python programs.

Variables

Variables are used to store data so it can be used later.

Variables are created using the = sign
Variable names must start with a letter or _
They can contain letters, numbers, and _
Variable names are case-sensitive
Names should be clear and meaningful
A variable must have a value before it can be used.

Assignment Operators

Python allows updating variables easily using:

+=
-=
*=
/=
These operators make the code shorter and easier to read.

Data Types

Python supports different types of data:

int – whole numbers
float – decimal numbers
bool – True or False
str – text
Python uses dynamic typing, which means a variable’s type can change. The type() function is used to check data types.

Built-in Functions

Built-in functions perform common tasks.

Examples:

print() – shows output
len() – counts characters or items
type() – shows data type
input() – gets user input
Some functions return values that can be stored in variables.

User Input and Type Conversion

The input() function always returns text (string). To do calculations, input must be converted using:

int()
float()
This prevents errors in calculations.

Strings

Strings store text and can use:

Single quotes ' '
Double quotes " "
Triple quotes """ """
Escape Characters

Special characters include:

\n new line
\t tab
\\ backslash
Triple Quotes

Used for multi-line text and documentation.

Indexing and Slicing

Strings are sequences of characters.

Indexing accesses one character (starts from 0)
Slicing extracts part of a string using [start:end]
Negative indexing counts from the end
Out-of-range slicing does not cause errors
Lists

Lists store multiple values inside [].

Lists are ordered
Can contain duplicates
Support indexing and slicing
Can be combined using + and repeated using *
Mutable and Immutable

Strings are immutable – cannot be changed
Lists are mutable – can be changed
List items can be modified using indexing, slicing, or append().

Conclusion

This lab helped develop skills in working with data using Python. Learning about variables, data types, strings, and lists is important for building more advanced programs in future labs.
